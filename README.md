# lri - Lightweight Rust Interpreter (WIP)

**lri** is a lightweight Rust interpreter currently in its early development stages. The goal is to provide basic lexical analysis, parsing, and expression evaluation, making it a simple yet functional tool for interpreting Rust code snippets.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizes input code into meaningful units.
- **Parsing:** Parses tokenized code into a structured representation.
- **Expression Evaluation:** Evaluates parsed expressions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rewindbytes/lri.git
   cd lri

2. **Build and Run**
   ```bash
   cargo build
